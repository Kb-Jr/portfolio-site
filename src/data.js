These values can be pulled and saved to local storage by using “localStorage.setItem” and the arguments should contain a key and the stringified version of the input details which were initially a javascript object. The Items saved in the local storage is then fetched using “localStorage.getItem” and used to build the bookmarks. A parsed version of the details is used to populate the built DOM elements. To delete a bookmark, the bookmarks array is looped over to find the object index that matches the index of the bookmark clicked. That particular object is then removed from the array using the splice method and returns a new array of objects without the clicked object",
